# Hello there üëã, my name is Juan

### Front-End Developer | Vue & Angular Specialist

My 'secret' lies in my commitment to continuous learning and my ability to combine code, functionality, and testing. With over 3 years of experience developing front-end applications with Vue, Nuxt, and Angular, I'm passionate about delivering clean, maintainable, and well-tested code.

While proficient in popular UI frameworks like Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and Angular Material. What sets me apart as a Front-End Developer is my focus on building robust and maintainable applications, not only aesthetically pleasing ones. My implementation of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in my previous role led to a 20% decrease in bug occurrences.

When I, a ChemEngü•º, decided to pivot to software development,I began learning and working with React :atom_symbol: and that helped me not only to build my foundational skills, but also would give me the chance to make the best chemical puns.

While I initially experimented‚öóÔ∏è with React, I found my true elements in Vue and Angular which, combined with TypeScript, create the perfect compound for building awesome web apps, which are now my primary frameworks.
